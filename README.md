# CN-Docker-Project

TEACUP (TCP Experimentation Automation Controlled Using Python) is an automated framework to setup a testbed for 
real time experimentation of TCP. This framework has been proposed by Swinburne University, Australia and has 
been in use since past few years (http://caia.swin.edu.au/tools/teacup/). 
However, setting up this framework is a tedious job and takes away several months. 

At NITK, this framework has been set up successfully. This project aims to use the docker technology to simplify the 
setting of TEACUP in future.
