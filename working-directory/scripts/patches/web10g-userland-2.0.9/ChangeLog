web10g-userland-2.0.7:

	N.B.  Changed licensing to MIT license.

	As a result of the change of license, the underlying intrusive
	list structure has been changed from that of glibc (LGPL) to of a
	version from CCAN (http://ccodearchive.net). This implementation
	has several benefits, beyond the MIT licensing. It performs several
	sanity checks when configured with --enable-debug; list_for_each
	has a more user-friendly interface. As a consequence of the latter,
	code that had previously used ESTATS_LIST_FOREACH will have to
	accommodate minor changes; examples of use are given in util/C.

	Added web10g- prefix to utils to distinguish from those similarly
	named web100 utils, for those uers comparing the two.

	Added missing free(str) following allocation by estats_val_as_string.

	Cleaner output for listconninfo and deltavars.
	
web10g-userland-2.0.6.2:

	Added record-to-file read/write functions and data type.

	Added listconninfo structure and functions for associating uid,
	pid, cmdline, to connection tuple.

	Reverted naming conventions for functions/lib to "estats".

	Added doc/API.txt giving an overview and explication of main lib
	functions.

	Minor bug fixes.

web10g-userland-2.0.4:

	Fixed reporting of IPv6 addresses in tcpe_list_conns.

	Added tcpe_write_var function and example client (writevar).
	N.B. currently writevar is only implemented for two of the four
	writable variables defined in RFC 4898, LimCwnd and LimRwin.
	This is an initial implementation, and deserves further testing,
	but has been included in this release for consideration.

	Added function tcpe_data_delta for taking difference of counters,
	and client deltavars.
